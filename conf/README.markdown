## conf/
The _conf/_ folder contains the tomcat's configuration. Therefor every knwon configuration file can be overwritten in here. In the default setup the following configurations will be included. Refer to the [tomcat configuration guide](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/) for further information on configuring a tomcat installation.

### Catalina/localhost/manager.xml
This file holds the context configuration for the tomcat's default manager application. The manager will be referenced from CATALINA_HOME as configured in your _start.sh_:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Context docBase="${catalina.home}/webapps/manager"
    antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true" >
</Context>
```

__From the tomcat docs (RUNNING.txt):__

> It might be useful to note that the values of __CATALINA_HOME__ and
> __CATALINA_BASE__ can be referenced in the XML configuration files processed
> by Tomcat as __${catalina.home}__ and __${catalina.base}__ respectively.

### context.xml
Contains the container context configuration specifying application resources. 
Initially this configuration file is empty.

### tomcat-users.xml
The tomcat roles and user file. This file initially contains some default users that can be used from within your application (i.e. security constraints in your application's _web.xml_):

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<tomcat-users>
	<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
	<role rolename="manager-script"/>
	<role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
	<role rolename="manager-status"/>
	<role tolename="tomcat"/>
	<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="tomcat"/>
	<user username="admin" password="s3cret" roles="manager-gui"/>
</tomcat-users>
```

### server.xml
Tomcat server configuration. The configuration contains some minor changes to the Connectors' ports in constrast to a freshly downloaded tomcat installation. The port used go from 11000 up to 11999 splitted in blocks รก 10 Ports per application (at least that's the plan). You can, of course, apply other port ranges if neccessary.
